    ### note these packages are not signed, see the LICENSE section
    deb http://debian.pkgs.cpan.org/debian unstable main

    ### update your sources & search for debified cpan distributions
    apt-get update
    apt-cache search libtest-harness-perl

    ### to create them yourself
    apt-get install cpan-libcpanplus-perl            
    apt-get install cpan-libcpanplus-dist-build-perl
    apt-get install cpan-libcpanplus-dist-deb-perl

=head1 MOTIVATION

This mirror has been created because even the C<debian unstable> 
repositories usually lag behind the C<CPAN> releases (ie there are
newer versions of a package on C<CPAN> than you can find in the 
C<debian> repositories). On top of that, not all packages on C<CPAN>
are available in the standard C<debian unstable> repositories.

This mirror attempts to amend some of these issues.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<debian.pkgs.cpan.org> is a C<debian> repository containing a selection
of C<CPAN> modules, converted on the fly from their native C<CPAN> 
package format, to a C<debian> package.

You can make use of this feature by adding a line to your 
C<sources.list> as described in the C<SYNOPSIS>.

Note that all our automatically generated packages are prefixed with 
C<cpan->, so you can easily recognize them, and they do not conflict 
with any of the C<debian> provided packages. Furthermore, all 
dependencies are listed as C<libfoo-perl | cpan-libfoo-perl>, which
makes it possible to mix and match, making you not solely reliant on
this mirror to satisfy prerequisites.
See the C<EXAMPLE> section below for a detailed description of the
C<debian> metadata.

=head1 DOING IT YOURSELF

If a C<CPAN> package you are looking for is not provided here, but 
you'd like to attempt to create your own C<debian> package from it 
anyway, you can do so installing the following packages from this
mirror:

=over 4

=item cpan-libcpanplus-perl

The C<CPANPLUS> library, required for fetching and compiling modules

=item cpan-libcpanplus-dist-build

The C<Module::Build> plugin, to be able to compile modules that
use C<Module::Build> as their installer

=item cpan-libcpanplus-dist-deb

The C<debian> plugin, to create C<.deb> files of every package and
installing them using C<dpkg>.

=back

If you wish to create your own C<.debs> you can do so by following
the instructions above and installing the relevant packages for it.

After installation, please refer to C<perldoc CPANPLUS::Dist::Deb>
for details.

Note: If you wish the creation of C<.debs> to be the default behaviour,
change your config as follows, from the default shell:

    CPAN Terminal> s conf dist_type CPANPLUS::Dist::Deb; s save

=head1 EXAMPLE

Below is an example of how C<Test::Simple> looks, once it has been 
debified for this mirror:

    $ dpkg -I cpan-libtest-simple-perl_0.62-1_all.deb

=head1 LICENSE

Note that all of the C<.debs> created and put on this mirror, as well
as ones created by yourself still adhere to the same license as the
original package; By releasing a package to CPAN we assume the license
permits automatic repackaging, but we do not guarantee this is the case!

All packages presented here, or created by C<CPANPLUS::Dist::Deb> in
general come without warranty or even fitness of use; use at your own
risk at your own discretion.

If licenses are of major concern to you C<DO NOT USE THIS MIRROR> but
stick to the official debian mirrors instead!
